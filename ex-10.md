## Exercise for Class 10

There wil be times when you need to take some kind of "external script"
and add it to the av-repo for internal use.

**WARNING**
Be careful about the "LICENSE".
There are legal concerns when using third party code.
(The license on this repo is "permissive".
So, this repo is ok. But, always double check.)


1. Copy the script `ex_10.py` into your "experimental directory".

    Update the `BUILD` file used last week to include a target for
    this new script.

    All you need is to create a new `av_py_binary` entry with a `name`
    and a `srcs` fields.

    Example:
    ```
    av_py_binary(
      name = "test",
      srcs = ["test.py"],
    )
    ```

1. Clean up the output.

    Clean up the output so the authors and years line up.

    For example:
    ```
    To Kill a Mockingbird         -> By Harper Lee              (1960)
    1984                          -> By George Orwell           (1949)
    The Great Gatsby              -> By F. Scott Fitzgerald     (1925)
    One Hundred Years of Solitude -> By Gabriel García Márquez  (1967)
    Moby Dick                     -> By Herman Melville         (1851)
    ```

1. EXTRA CREDIT: Print the number of book from each year in SORTED order.

    For example:
    ```
    -800 2
    1320 1
    1400 1
    ...
    ```

    HINT: There is the built-in `sorted()` function.
