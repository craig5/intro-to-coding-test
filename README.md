CLaskowski's fruit epic:  
The python is wrapped around an apple and glares at you  
The python is wrapped around 3 bananas and glares at you  
The python is wrapped around a lime and glares at you  
The python is wrapped around 298 cherries and glares at you  
The python becomes even more theoretical because -3 Is not a positive integer  
The python hisses at you because 42 is not an integer so no Kumquat for you  
The python hisses at you because U w0t m8 is not an integer so no chayote fruit for you  
The python hisses at you because 23.92856 is not an integer so no jackfruit for you
